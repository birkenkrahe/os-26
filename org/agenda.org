** Syllabus walk-through
#+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
[[../img/overview.png]]

- I originally planned to redevelop this course around the book by
  Brian Ward, How Linux Works. But when I looked at my material I
  thought it was good.

- To have full control over our Operating System, we will use the
  Raspberry Pi 500, which runs Raspbian Linux.

- There is a plethora of books available, ranging from very
  theoretical and abstract to very hands-on system programming. All of
  them are very weighty (because there is a lot to know).

** Why Linux?

- Linux lets you see what the operating system is doing, instead of
  hiding it behind graphical interfaces.

- The tools you use in Linux make it possible to observe processes,
  memory use, files, and networking directly.

- Linux is the operating system behind most servers, cloud systems,
  and embedded devices, so the skills you learn transfer beyond this
  course.

- Working in Linux helps you understand how programs interact with the
  operating system, not just how to run them.

- Linux supports modern system concepts such as containers and
  resource isolation, which are widely used in industry.

- Learning Linux makes you more confident and independent when working
  with any computing environment.

** [P]Review Questions: Virtualization, OS, and Hardware

Q&A by ChatGPT (extracted exclusively from the whiteboard).

1. What is the conceptual difference between a *virtual machine (VM)*
   and a *container*?
   #+begin_quote
   A virtual machine virtualizes an entire operating system (including
   its own kernel), while a container shares the host OS kernel and
   isolates applications at the process level.
   #+end_quote

2. Why are platforms like Google Colab or Linux VMs suitable for
   running Linux environments on non-Linux hosts?
   #+begin_quote
   They abstract the underlying hardware by running Linux inside a
   virtualized environment, allowing Linux tools and workflows to run
   independently of the host OS.
   #+end_quote

3. What role does Docker play in the container ecosystem?
   #+begin_quote
   Docker provides tooling to build, distribute, and run containers
   that package applications with their dependencies while sharing the
   host kernel.
   #+end_quote

4. What problem do container *orchestrators* like Kubernetes solve?
   #+begin_quote
   They manage the deployment, scaling, networking, and lifecycle of
   multiple containers across one or more machines.
   #+end_quote

5. hat is the role of the *shell* relative to the *kernel*?
   #+begin_quote
   The shell is a user-level program that translates user commands
   into *system calls* handled by the kernel.
   #+end_quote

6. What is a *pipeline* in a Unix-like shell (e.g., =ls | wc -l=)?
   #+begin_quote
   A pipeline connects the output of one command directly to the input
   of another, enabling composition of simple programs.
   #+end_quote

7. Why is RAM described as “fast” compared to non-volatile memory?
   #+begin_quote
   RAM provides low-latency, high-bandwidth access for active
   programs, whereas non-volatile memory is slower but persistent.
   #+end_quote

8. What is the function of the I/O bus in the hardware diagram?
   #+begin_quote
   The I/O bus connects the CPU and memory to peripheral devices such as keyboards, displays, storage, and network interfaces.
   #+end_quote

9. In a typical process virtual memory layout, what is the difference
   between the *stack* and the *heap*?
   #+begin_quote
   The stack is used for *function* calls and local variables with
   automatic lifetime, while the heap is used for dynamically
   allocated memory with manual or managed lifetime (like *vector*).
   #+end_quote

10. Why can containers generally start faster and use fewer resources
    than virtual machines?
    #+begin_quote
    Because containers do not boot a full OS or run a separate kernel;
    they reuse the host kernel and isolate processes instead.
    #+end_quote
