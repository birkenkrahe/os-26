** DONE Syllabus walk-through
#+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
[[../img/overview.png]]

- I originally planned to redevelop this course around the book by
  Brian Ward, How Linux Works. But when I looked at my material I
  thought it was good.

- To have full control over our Operating System, we will use the
  Raspberry Pi 500, which runs Raspbian Linux.

- There is a plethora of books available, ranging from very
  theoretical and abstract to very hands-on system programming. All of
  them are very weighty (because there is a lot to know).

** DONE Why Linux?

- Linux lets you see what the operating system is doing, instead of
  hiding it behind graphical interfaces.

- The tools you use in Linux make it possible to observe processes,
  memory use, files, and networking directly.

- Linux is the operating system behind most servers, cloud systems,
  and embedded devices, so the skills you learn transfer beyond this
  course.

- Working in Linux helps you understand how programs interact with the
  operating system, not just how to run them.

- Linux supports modern system concepts such as containers and
  resource isolation, which are widely used in industry.

- Learning Linux makes you more confident and independent when working
  with any computing environment.

** DONE [P]Review Questions: Virtualization, OS, and Hardware

[Q&A by ChatGPT - extracted exclusively from whiteboard screenshots.]

1. What is the conceptual difference between a *virtual machine (VM)*
   and a *container*?
   #+begin_quote
   A virtual machine virtualizes an entire operating system (including
   its own kernel), while a container shares the host OS kernel and
   isolates applications at the process level.
   #+end_quote

2. Why are platforms like Google Colab or Linux VMs suitable for
   running Linux environments on non-Linux hosts?
   #+begin_quote
   They abstract the underlying hardware by running Linux inside a
   virtualized environment, allowing Linux tools and workflows to run
   independently of the host OS.
   #+end_quote

3. What role does Docker play in the container ecosystem?
   #+begin_quote
   Docker provides tooling to build, distribute, and run containers
   that package applications with their dependencies while sharing the
   host kernel.
   #+end_quote

4. What problem do container *orchestrators* like Kubernetes solve?
   #+begin_quote
   They manage the deployment, scaling, networking, and lifecycle of
   multiple containers across one or more machines.
   #+end_quote

5. What is the role of the *shell* relative to the *kernel*?
   #+begin_quote
   The shell is a user-level program that translates user commands
   into *system calls* handled by the kernel.
   #+end_quote

6. What is a *pipeline* in a Unix-like shell (e.g., =ls | wc -l=)?
   #+begin_quote
   A pipeline connects the output of one command directly to the input
   of another, enabling composition of simple programs.
   #+end_quote

7. Why is RAM described as “fast” compared to non-volatile memory?
   #+begin_quote
   RAM provides low-latency, high-bandwidth access for active
   programs, whereas non-volatile memory is slower but persistent.
   #+end_quote

8. What is the function of the I/O bus in the hardware diagram?
   #+begin_quote
   The I/O bus connects the CPU and memory to peripheral devices such
   as keyboards, displays, storage, and network interfaces.
   #+end_quote

9. In a typical process virtual memory layout, what is the difference
   between the *stack* and the *heap*?
   #+begin_quote
   The stack is used for *function* calls and *local* variables with
   automatic lifetime, while the heap is used for dynamically
   allocated memory with manual or managed lifetime (like *vector*).
   #+end_quote

10. Why can containers generally start faster and use fewer resources
    than virtual machines?
    #+begin_quote
    Because containers do not boot a full OS or run a separate kernel;
    they reuse the host kernel and isolate processes instead.
    #+end_quote

** Review: OS fundamentals I

[Generated by ChatGPT based on the course materials presented.]

1. What is the primary role of an operating system (OS) in a computer
   system?
   #+begin_quote
   To manage hardware resources and provide an abstraction layer for
   applications.
   #+end_quote

2. What happens inside a computer system when a user presses a key and
   a character appears on the screen?
   #+begin_quote
   An application (~bash~) requests resources, the OS kernel schedules
   the CPU and allocates memory, and the CPU executes the task using
   RAM (also involves using the IO/bus, and the display adapter).
   #+end_quote

3. Why does process scheduling become necessary in a multitasking
   system?
   #+begin_quote
   Multiple processes compete for CPU time and must be coordinated by
   the OS. To begin with, you have one process on one CPU by one user,
   and on Linux, you have multiple processes run by multiple CPUs, for
   multiple users.
   #+end_quote

4. What challenges can arise from unclear or simultaneous input
   events?
   #+begin_quote
   Conflicting signals must be interpreted and handled correctly by
   the OS and device drivers, which means the OS needs to decide who
   comes first and who gets how much memory when.
   #+end_quote

5. What is the purpose of separating user mode from kernel mode?
   #+begin_quote
   To prevent user programs from executing privileged operations or
   accessing hardware directly.
   #+end_quote

6. What problem do container technologies aim to address in modern
   computing systems?
   #+begin_quote
   They provide isolated, portable environments for running
   applications. E.g. a docker container with a Python environment.
   #+end_quote

7. How do containers differ from full virtual machines in their use of
   system resources?
   #+begin_quote
   Containers share the host kernel (the machine on which the
   container runs), while virtual machines (VM) run a complete guest
   operating system (on the host machine).
   #+end_quote

8. What does it mean for software to run on “bare metal”?
   #+begin_quote
   It runs directly on hardware without a virtualization layer (like
   an OS - which is a layer of abstraction on top of the hardware).
   #+end_quote

9. Why is version control (e.g. with Git) useful when managing system
   configuration or documentation files?
   #+begin_quote
   It enables tracking changes, collaboration, and reproducibility.
   #+end_quote

10. How does the operating system manage multiple users and
    applications on the same machine?
    #+begin_quote
    The kernel allocates resources and enforces isolation and
    protection by managing the resources automatically.
    #+end_quote

** CSC 420 – Beginner Term Project Ideas

- Rationale
  #+begin_quote
  These projects go beyond class activities by asking you to take
  ownership of a topic over the entire term. Instead of following
  step-by-step instructions, you will decide what to explore, design
  your own experiments, and refine your explanations through multiple
  sprint reviews. The focus is on understanding and explaining how Linux
  behaves in real situations, not just running commands.
  #+end_quote

- Project list:

  1. *Linux System Map:* Build a structured overview of the Linux system
     layout, key directories, configuration files, running services,
     and attached hardware, with explanations.

  2. *Process Life Cycle Diary:* Observe and document how processes are
     created, scheduled, paused, and terminated using standard
     process-monitoring tools.

  3. *Users, Groups, and Permissions Explorer:* Investigate how Linux
     manages users, groups, file ownership, and permissions through
     controlled experiments and examples.

  4. *Disk Usage and Filesystem Explorer*: Examine disks, partitions,
     mounts, and filesystem usage, explaining how storage is organized
     and reported by the OS.

  5. *Boot and Startup Observation Project:* Trace what happens during
     system startup after the kernel loads, focusing on services,
     timing, and logs.

  6. *System Logs as a Narrative:* Analyze system logs to reconstruct
     what the system is doing over time and how events are recorded.

  7. *Resource Monitoring Notebook*: Monitor CPU, memory, and I/O usage
     under different workloads and explain observed behavior.

  8. *Networking Basics in Practice:* Explore network interfaces, IP
     addressing, routing, DNS, and open ports using standard Linux
     tools.

  9. *Shell Automation Helper Tool:* Develop a small shell script that
     automates a common system task and explain how it interacts with
     the OS.

  10. *Configuration Files in Practice:* Explore how Linux configuration
      files in /etc control system behavior by inspecting, comparing,
      and safely modifying selected configuration files, and
      documenting their effects.

- Using AI agents:
  #+begin_quote
  You may use AI agents as helpers while working on your project—for
  example, to suggest commands, draft regular expressions, or help
  interpret output. However, agents are only assistants: you are
  responsible for testing everything they produce and for explaining
  how and why it works. The goal is to use agents to support your
  learning and exploration, not to replace your own understanding.

* Week 3 ("Winter week"): DataCamp Review & OS Fundamentals II
#+attr_html: :width 400px :float nil:
[[../img/summary_21_jan_2.png]]

- [ ] Projects? Anyone? Canvas list?
- [ ] DataCamp Review: 
- [ ] OS Fundamentals II
- [ ] Quiz 2: Manipulating Data (based on DataCamp lesson)

** DataCamp Review: Manipulating files and directories

1) *Shell vs. Desktop (Conceptual):* In one or two sentences, state one
   key difference between using a shell and using a graphical desktop
   interface.
   #+begin_quote
   The shell is a text-based interface where commands are typed; a
   graphical desktop uses visual elements such as windows, icons, and
   menus.
   #+end_quote

2) *Current Location:* Which command prints the current working
   directory? Write the command exactly.
   #+begin_example sh
   pwd
   #+end_example

3) *Reading Paths:* If the shell prints the following output, where are
   you?  /home/student/projects Is this an absolute path or a relative
   path?
   #+begin_quote
   Absolute path; it starts at the root directory (/).
   #+end_quote

4) *Listing Files:* What command lists the contents of the current
   working directory and prints the number of files?
   #+begin_example sh
   ls -l | wc -l
   #+end_example

5) *Interpreting:* In a long listing (~ls -l~), what does the first
   character of each line indicate?
   #+begin_quote
   It indicates the file type (for example, regular file, directory,
   or symbolic link).
   #+end_quote

6) *Changing Directories:* Write the command to move into a directory
   named data that is inside the current directory.
   #+begin_example sh
   cd data
   #+end_example

7) *Moving Up:* What does the following command do?  ~cd ..~
   #+begin_quote
   It moves from the current directory to its parent directory.
   #+end_quote

8) *Copy vs. Move:* Which command would you use to duplicate a file, and
   which command would you use to relocate a file?
   #+begin_quote
   ~cp~ duplicates a file; ~mv~ relocates a file.
   #+end_quote

9) *Renaming Files:* In Linux, which command is used to rename a file, and why does that make sense conceptually?
   #+begin_quote
   ~mv~ - renaming is treated as moving a file from one pathname to
   another.
   #+end_quote

10) *Deleting Directories:* Why must a directory usually be empty before
    it can be deleted from the shell?
    #+begin_quote
    To reduce the risk of accidentally deleting all files contained in
    the directory.
    #+end_quote
