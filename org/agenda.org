- I originally planned to redevelop this course around the book by
  Brian Ward, How Linux Works. But when I looked at my material I
  thought it was good.

- To have full control over our Operating System, we will use the
  Raspberry Pi 500, which runs Raspbian Linux.

- There is a plethora of books available, ranging from very
  theoretical and abstract to very hands-on system programming. All of
  them are very weighty (because there is a lot to know).

** Why Linux?

- Linux lets you see what the operating system is doing, instead of
  hiding it behind graphical interfaces.

- The tools you use in Linux make it possible to observe processes,
  memory use, files, and networking directly.

- Linux is the operating system behind most servers, cloud systems,
  and embedded devices, so the skills you learn transfer beyond this
  course.

- Working in Linux helps you understand how programs interact with the
  operating system, not just how to run them.

- Linux supports modern system concepts such as containers and
  resource isolation, which are widely used in industry.

- Learning Linux makes you more confident and independent when working
  with any computing environment.
