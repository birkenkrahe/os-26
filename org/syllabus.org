* Standard and course policies

*Standard Lyon College Policies* are incorporated into this syllabus
and can be found at: [[http://www.lyon.edu/standard-course-policies][lyon.edu/standard-course-policies]].

The *Assignments and Honor Code* and the *Attendance Policy* are
incorporated into this syllabus also and can be found at:

* Objectives

Operating systems provide the abstraction layer between hardware and
applications, coordinating resources such as CPU, memory, storage,
and I/O while supporting concurrency, isolation, and security. In
this course, we study operating systems *through the concrete lens of
Linux*, using Brian Ward’s /How Linux Works/ as the primary text.

Rather than treating OS concepts abstractly, we examine how they are
implemented and observed on real systems: processes and threads,
filesystems, devices, boot loaders, init systems, networking, and
virtualization. Emphasis is placed on understanding *how things
actually work*, how to inspect system behavior, and how user space and
kernel space interact.

By the end of the course, students should feel confident navigating,
inspecting, configuring, and reasoning about a modern Linux system,
and understand the core principles that generalize to other operating
systems.

* Student Learning Outcomes

Students who complete CSC 420 "Operating Systems (OS)", will be
able to:

- Explain the role of the operating system as a resource manager and
  abstraction layer
- Describe Linux system architecture, including kernel, user space,
  and hardware interfaces
- Inspect and reason about processes, threads, and resource usage
- Understand Linux boot processes, init systems, and service
  management
- Work with filesystems, storage devices, and memory (including swap)
- Explain how Linux handles devices, networking, and IPC mechanisms
- Use standard Linux tools to trace system calls and monitor system
  behavior
- Understand core concepts behind containers, virtualization, and
  isolation
- Relate practical Linux mechanisms to general operating systems
  principles

* Course requirements

Some knowledge of, and experience with computers is useful but not
critical: we will start from basic concepts. Curiosity and personal
discipline are essential. You will gain data literacy skills by
taking this course. The course will prepare you for further studies
in computer and data science, or in other disciplines that use
modern computing, i.e. every discipline, from accounting to
zoology).

For a deeper understanding of the concepts, familiarity with basic
data structures, computer architecture, and a high-level language,
such as C or Java, is useful.

Formal prerequisites according to the Lyon College 2023/24 catalog:
CSC 265 (algorithms).

* Grading system

| WHAT                    | WEIGHT |
|-------------------------+--------|
| Assignments             |    25% |
| Project                 |    25% |
| Tests                   |    25% |
| Final exam (optional)   |    25% |

*Notes:*
- To pass: 60% of all available points.
- Assignments include
- Tests: weekly online quizzes, which are previewed and reviewed in
  class.
- Final exam: selection of the most challenging weekly quiz questions
  either as a written or as an oral exam. You only have to write the
  final exam if you want to improve your grade at the end of the
  course. If the final exam result is below your final grade average
  up to this point, it will be ignored.
- There will be numerous (optional) bonus assignments to improve your
  midterm and final grades.

* Use of AI Tools

Students may use AI-based tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Copilot) as assistive
systems for generating shell commands, scripts, or
explanations. However, all AI-generated material must be treated as
unverified output. This course emphasizes understanding how operating
systems actually behave, and students are responsible for testing,
validating, and explaining any AI-assisted work. In particular,
students must be able to explain why a command or script works, under
what conditions it may fail, and how it interacts with the operating
system (processes, permissions, files, resources). Submitting
AI-generated output without understanding or attribution is not
acceptable. The ability to critically evaluate AI output is considered
part of operating systems literacy.

* Grading table

This table is used to convert completion rates into letter grades. for
the midterm results, letter grades still carry signs, while for the
term results, only straight letters are given (by rounding up). This
table is also used in Canvas to compute your grades. Transitions
between letter grades are rounded (e.g. 89.5% to 90%).

|------------------+------------------|
| Percentage       | LETTER GRADE*    |
|------------------+------------------|
| 100% to 89.5%    | A (very good)    |
|------------------+------------------|
| < 89.5% to 79.5% | B (good)         |
|------------------+------------------|
| < 79.5% to 69.5% | C (satisfactory) |
|------------------+------------------|
| < 69.5% to 59.5% | D (passed)       |
|------------------+------------------|
| < 59.5% to 0%    | F (FAILED)       |
|------------------+------------------|
